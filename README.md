# findsum
This project aims to check if an array has two or more integer numbers that sum is equals a expected integer number.
If the arguments are [1,2,5,7,10] and 16 it should return true because 1 + 5 + 10 = 16.
However, for [1,3,7] and 9 it should return false because there is no a combination that sum is 9.
